p. Rah_change_passwords is a "Textpattern":http://textpattern.com plugin that allows "Publishers":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=User_Roles_and_Permissions to freely change any user's password and resetting login sessions directly from the "Users":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Users panel.

p. The main difference to Textpattern CMS' built in password resetting feature is that you as a Publisher, and the site's main administrator, can change any user's passwords to anything you want. As such, users do not need to receive emails containing automatically generated passwords or do password restoring themselves.

h2. Requirements

p. Minimum requirements:

* Textpattern 4.5.0 or newer.

h2. Installing

p. Rah_change_passwords' installation follows the standard plugin installation steps.

# Download the plugin installation code.
# Copy and paste the installation code into the _Install plugin_ box of your Textpattern Plugin pane.
# Run the automated setup.
# After the setup is done, activate the plugin. Done.

h2. Usage

p. Rah_change_password will add extra options to the "Users":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Users panel's editor. When logged in with a "Publisher":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=User_Roles_and_Permissions account, you will see options to change the password when editing any user account. These added extra options include a way to reset login sessions, to change and optionally email passwords.
